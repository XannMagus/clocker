- Add a `TimeLog` struct with a single field `entries: Vec<TimeLogEntry>`
- Add an impl block for that struct with public methods:
    - from_file (does basically what `read_logs` does currently)
    - persist (does basically what `write_logs` does currently)
    - update, which computes the time variables (now, today, current_time) and then calls the method determine_action and apply_action which both can be private
- Move this in its own module
- Move the data structure `TimeLogEntry` to its own submodule of `TimeLog`
- Depending on the readability, keep the enums `TimeOfDay` and `Action` in the `TimeLog` module or move them to their own submodule
